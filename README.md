# CPE_getnextline_2017
The goal of this project is to write a function that returns a read line from a file descriptor. If there are no more lines to return, or if there is an error during the reading, the function will come back NULL . You must define a macro called READ_SIZE in your get_next_line.h file, which indicates the amount of characters to be read for each read() call.
